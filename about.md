This site was created by faculty at GSIR as a place to share advice with prospective and current MA students.

The information here is intended to be informal advice only, different members of faculty may have different approaches and opinions, your adviser's advice and opinion should be given priority over anything you read here.

Similarly, this advice is 'unofficial' and information from the GSIR administrative office should be given priority.

**Good luck with your application!**
