title: The Graduation Thesis
---

Towards the end of your two years you will submit your Master's Thesis (*Shūron*). Your adviser and co-adviser will assess it and if it fulfils the requirements listed in the Handbook (see below) it will be passed and you will have the opportunity to defend it at the Oral Defense Examination (*kōtō shimon*). This page looks at the criteria used to assess the thesis and offers some advice.

# Format Requirements

Length: 15-20,000 words. If you want/need to write more, you will need to get permission from your adviser. The requirements are somewhat different for GJP students, please check the current Handbook for details.
