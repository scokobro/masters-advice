title: The Graduation Thesis
---

Towards the end of your two years you will submit your Master's Thesis (*Shūron*). Your adviser and co-adviser will assess it and if it fulfils the requirements listed in the Handbook (see below) it will be passed and you will have the opportunity to defend it at the Oral Defense Examination (*kōtō shimon*). This page looks at the criteria used to assess the thesis and offers some advice.

# Length Requirements

**Length:** 15-20,000 words

The words in footnotes are counted toward this total, the following are not:

* words in your bibliographical references,
* words in your abstract,
* words included in tables, graphs and charts.

If you want/need to write more than 20,000 words, you will need to get permission from your adviser. The requirements are somewhat different for GJP students, please check the current Handbook for details.

# Assessment Criteria

From the Handbook:

**Formality requirements**

1) Fulfill requirements regarding the required number of words

2) Be formatted appropriately (for example, the sources of diagrams must be noted, appropriate footnotes and citations, etc.)

3) Include an attached abstract

**Substance Evaluation**

4) Be sufficiently grounded on previous academic work in the relevant field

5) In the case of empirical research: must demonstrate an accurate understanding of the facts. For theoretical research: must contain a well-organized outline of theories and critical review

6) Be organized appropriately into chapters, sections etc., and show logical consistency (logical development and linkage of each chapter/section)

7) Demonstrate creativity (new points of view and new findings)

8) Be defended through appropriate responses during the oral defense (*kōtō shimon*)


# Advice regarding these Criteria

## 1) Length

This is straightforward; a masters thesis has to be of a certain size, the idea is that you demonstrate your ability to create a consistent piece of work which brings together diverse elements in a logical manner.

## 2) Formatting

The official guidance here is vague. My suggestion would be that your work should, in many ways, look like an academic book.

## 3) Abstract

The role of an abstract is to allow the person reading it to get an idea of what the work says; it is a highly compressed version of the whole thesis. It includes mentions of the theoretical approaches involved, the research question, the methodologies and data used, the results and, briefly, the important findings and conclusions of the work.

## 4) Literature Review

This is probably one of the most important sections of your thesis, it is also one of the most difficult to get right. One of the things you are trying to demonstrate in your thesis is that you have a decent understanding of the relevant literature for your topic, of course this means that you have to have identified, read and understood this literature! I would go so far as to say that *reading* is the main job of a masters student; I would suggest that even though your aim is to 'write a thesis', the activity you spend most of your time on isn't writing, it's *reading*. For a masters degree I would suggest that about 70% of your time is for reading, 20% for writing, and 10% thinking. Not that thinking is not important but your first job is to acquire information and knowledge *with which to think!*

If you want to know more about literature reviews and how to write them Google around a few university websites, they often have good guides.

## 5) Hmmm...

This criteria seems to be an artefact of the original Japanese language phrasing. It's unlikely that anyone will be writing a thesis that is ONLY theory or ONLY empirical, so what we have to assume here is that this criteria ultimately means; make sure your facts and figures are accurate and up-to-date, and make sure you have chosen appropriate theoretical approaches for reasons which you understand and are able to justify.

## 6) Organisation
